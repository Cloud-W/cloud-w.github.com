This is Cloud, a newbie indie game developer.

## In the past

- I've been using Unity to create stupid mobile games (or let's say, **ads display apps**).
- I wished I could make **real** games, but was too exhausted to start.

## And now

- I'm making desktop games with Godot Engine.
- I'm tying to share my learning experience of using Godot.
- I'm learning pixel painting with Aseprite.
